Advanced Responsive Design Project : Build a complete responsive website on any topic of your choices, using the principles discussed below:

•	A responsive website should include a grid system, media queries, and images that resize, fluid typography and CSS transitions and transformations.

•	Your grid system and media queries should be custom-coded. (You may not use Bootstrap, Foundation, or another grid system or media queries.)

•	The grid system must have at least 3 columns. It can have as many as you want.

•	You should include at least two unique media queries in your CSS. You may have more than this if you require it. 
  You may repeat the same media query more than once, but that doesn't count towards "unique" media queries.
  
•	The images that resize may be a solution that you download, or the HTML5 solution. Use a solution from class or use another solution you’ve found 
  that you like better. You must resize at least one image in the site.
  
•	The typography across website needs to be fluid

•	Demonstrate these transforms and transitions properties somewhere in your website. They can be part of a UI element, or they might be a stand- alone element.

•	Transforms: Include at least 2 types of transforms.

•	Transition: At least 2 transitions.
  All the above may apply to the same element or to 2 different elements, or any combinations therein.
  Transitions may be triggered on hover, on the active state of a link, or on page load.
  
•	The site should include a navigation bar that links the relevant pages together, and it should be available on all pages of the site.
